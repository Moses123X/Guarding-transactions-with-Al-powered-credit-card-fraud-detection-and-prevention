# Guarding-transactions-with-Al-powered-credit-card-fraud-detection-and-prevention
1.Problem Statement  
Credit card fraud is a growing concern, with global losses exceeding $32 billion in 
2023 (Nilson Report). Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems fail to keep up 
with: • Evolving fraud tactics (e.g., synthetic identity fraud, deepfake scams). • 
High false positives, leading to declined legitimate transactions and customer 
dissatisfaction. • Slow response times, allowing fraudsters to exploit delays. An AI
driven solution is needed to detect and prevent fraud in real time while minimizing 
false declines.

Real-Time Detection 
Reduce False Positives

Description 
Flag suspicious transactions within                      
milliseconds. 
Improve accuracy to avoid 
declininglegitimate transactions. 
Continuously update models based on new 
fraud patterns. 
 Detect anomalies in user spending habits. 
   
Scalability        Handle high transaction volumes  (e.g.,           
peak shopping seasons). 
 
Regulatory Compliance        Ensure adherence to PCI-DSS, GDPR, and 
CCPA. 
3.Scope of the Project  
In Scope 
 ✔ Transaction Monitoring – Real-time fraud scoring for card-not-present (CNP) 
and card-present (CP) transactions. ✔ Anomaly Detection – Unusual spending 
patterns, geolocation mismatches, velocity checks. ✔ User Authentication – 
Behavioral biometrics (keystrokes, swipe patterns). ✔ Model Explainability – 
Provide reasons for fraud flags (for compliance).  
Out of Scope  
    Non-financial Manual fraud (e.g., fraud identity investigation (focus theft 
Hardware security (e.g., EMV chip validation). outside on AI transactions).

5.High-Level Methodology  
Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing 
• Gather transaction logs, user behavior data, and fraud labels. 
• Clean data (handle missing values, normalize features). 
• Feature engineering (e.g., transaction frequency, time since last purchase). 
Step 2: Model Development 
• Supervised Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) for labeled 
fraud data 
.• Unsupervised Learning (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) for anomaly detection. 
• Graph AI to detect fraud rings (e.g., multiple cards linked to one account). 
Step 3: Real-Time Fraud Scoring 
• Deploy models in a streaming pipeline (e.g., Apache Kafka + Spark ML). 
• Assign risk scores (0-100) to each transaction. 
• Rules Engine (e.g., block if risk score > 85). 
Step 4: Continuous Learning & Optimization 
• Retrain models weekly with new fraud patterns.  
• A/B testing to compare model performance. 
• Feedback loop from fraud analysts to improve accuracy.
